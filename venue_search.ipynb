      "The National Association of Multicultural Education invites scholars, educators, activists, and advocates to explore the enduring relevance and transformative power of multicultural education in the face of evolving societal challenges. Weds. Nov. 13 – 17, 2024 Anaheim Hilton Conference Center Under the theme, \"Tested through the Tides of Time: Triumphs of Multicultural Education from Yesteryear to our Inevitable Futures,\" this conference seeks to celebrate the resilience and efficacy of multicultural education across generations and envision its role in shaping our collective destiny. Anchored in Anaheim, California, a city with a rich history of social justice movements and grassroots activism, this conference provides a poignant backdrop for examining the intersections of diversity, equity, and inclusion in education. From the civil rights era to the present day, Anaheim has been a bastion of progress and change, where communities have mobilized to confront injustice and champion the rights of marginalized groups. Against this backdrop, our conference theme underscores the imperative to reflect on the triumphs and challenges of multicultural education throughout history. By examining the lessons learned from the past, we can glean insights into the strategies and approaches that have propelled our movement forward, while also acknowledging the persistent barriers that continue to hinder progress. Moreover, as we stand at the precipice of an uncertain future, marked by unprecedented global challenges and rapidly shifting demographics, the need for multicultural education has never been more urgent. In an increasingly interconnected world, where diversity is both a source of strength and a catalyst for conflict, educators and advocates must equip themselves with the tools and knowledge to navigate this complex landscape with empathy, understanding, and resilience. Through a series of engaging keynote presentations, interactive workshops, scholarly panels, and networking opportunities, this conference will provide a platform for dialogue, collaboration, and action. Participants will have the opportunity to share best practices, exchange innovative ideas, and forge partnerships that transcend boundaries and foster meaningful change in their communities and beyond. Join us in Anaheim as we embark on a journey through time, exploring the enduring legacy of multicultural education and charting a course towards a future where diversity is celebrated, equity is upheld, and inclusion is the cornerstone of our educational systems. Together, let us test the waters of time and emerge stronger, wiser, and more determined than ever to realize the promise of a truly multicultural society.  HELP SPREAD THE WORD: Download Conference Flier to Post or Share:  • NAME Conference Flier PNG •  NAME Conference Flier PDF Early registration for the conference is OPEN!  CLICK HERE to REGISTER for NAME 2024 SCROLL DOWN – DISCOUNT DISNEYLAND TICKETS            &             Student Teams Deal Early Bird Registration Extended!!
