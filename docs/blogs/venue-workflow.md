# Venue Workflow Project

## Introduction
The Venue Workflow project is an innovative multi-agent system designed to streamline the process of identifying and evaluating potential venues for technology conference events in urban areas. By leveraging artificial intelligence and automation, the system efficiently researches suitable venues, analyzes their features, and scores them based on predefined criteria. The workflow not only saves time in venue discovery but also initiates contact with high-potential venues, creating a seamless bridge between event planners and venue operators. This solution addresses the common challenges of manual venue research while ensuring comprehensive coverage across different venue listing platforms like PartySlate and Peerspace. 

This is a multi-agent AI system designed to automate the process of finding and evaluating venues for technology conference events. The project, built using CrewAI framework, consists of three main components:
Venue Search Crew: Searches for venues near a specified location within a given radius using Serper API.
Venue Score Crew: Evaluates and scores venues based on predefined criteria, assigning specific scores (1-100) with detailed reasoning.
Venue Response Crew: Generates professional outreach emails to high-potential venues.

## Importance of Efficient Venue Management
Efficient venue management is crucial for successful event planning and execution. The process of finding, evaluating, and securing the right venue can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, often requiring extensive research across multiple platforms and direct communication with various venue operators. Without a streamlined approach, organizations risk overlooking ideal venues, missing crucial details in venue specifications, or making decisions based on incomplete information. Additionally, the manual nature of traditional venue research methods can lead to inconsistent evaluation criteria and potential oversights in important factors such as capacity, technical capabilities, and cost considerations. By implementing an automated and systematic approach to venue management, organizations can significantly reduce the time and effort required while ensuring more comprehensive and accurate venue assessments.

## Goals
The primary goals of this project are to automate and optimize the venue discovery process, standardize venue evaluation criteria across different platforms like PartySlate and Peerspace, enable less experienced team members to effectively manage venue searches, and provide comprehensive venue analysis that considers event-specific requirements such as networking events, tech workshops, and pitch competitions - ultimately saving time and improving the quality of venue selections for technology conference events.



## Background

The venue management landscape faces several key challenges that impact event planning efficiency and success. Traditional venue discovery methods often rely heavily on manual searches across multiple platforms, with popular sites like PartySlate and Peerspace each offering different venue types and experiences. While PartySlate tends to focus on traditional venues such as restaurants and hotels, Peerspace diversifies into unique spaces like art studios, mansions, clubhouses, and bars. This fragmentation of venue listings across platforms creates a significant challenge for comprehensive venue research. Additionally, the varying levels of venue engagement with these platforms - evidenced by "unclaimed" listings on PartySlate - can lead to incomplete or outdated information. These challenges are particularly pronounced when organizations aim to delegate venue finding tasks to less experienced team members, as they may lack the expertise to effectively navigate multiple platforms and evaluate venues consistently. The current solutions, while valuable, often limit users to their specific inventory and may not provide a complete picture of all available venues in a given area.


## Project Overview
The project scope encompasses several key components designed to create a comprehensive venue research and evaluation system. At its core, the workflow features a user-friendly interface that allows event planners to easily input search criteria and preferences. The system integrates seamlessly with existing venue platforms and databases, pulling real-time data from sources like PartySlate and Peerspace to provide up-to-date venue information. Through advanced data processing capabilities, the workflow analyzes venue details, availability, and suitability for different event types, presenting users with scored and ranked venue options. This automated approach not only streamlines the venue discovery process but also ensures consistent evaluation criteria across all potential venues, enabling even less experienced team members to make informed decisions about venue selection.

The system is implemented as a Streamlit web application that requires OpenAI and Serper API keys to function. Users can input location details, search radius, event information, and sender details. The workflow automates what would typically be a manual venue research process, making it more efficient and standardized.
The project uses Python 3.10-3.13, follows a modular architecture, and includes features for human-in-the-loop review of venue selections before proceeding with email generation.

## Technical Details
### Architecture
The system architecture follows a modular design pattern, leveraging Python as the primary programming language and Streamlit for the web interface. The core components include API integrations with OpenAI and Serper for intelligent venue analysis and search capabilities. The application is containerized using Docker for consistent deployment across environments, as evidenced by the devcontainer configuration. The workflow is structured around a multi-agent system where specialized agents handle different aspects of the venue research process, from initial discovery to detailed analysis and outreach. This architecture ensures scalability and maintainability while providing a robust foundation for future enhancements.

#### Coordination Flow
  The coordination flow works as follows:
  - The search crew finds venues and stores them in state.venues
  ```python
      @CrewBase
      class VenueSearchCrew:
          @crew
          def crew(self) -> Crew:
              return Crew(
                  agents=[self.location_analyst()],
                  tasks=[self.analyze_location()],
                  process=Process.sequential,
                  verbose=True,
              )
  ```
  - The scoring crew evaluates each venue and stores scores in state.venue_score
  ```python
    @CrewBase
    class VenueScoreCrew:
        @crew
        def crew(self) -> Crew:
            return Crew(
                agents=[self.scoring_agent()],
                tasks=[self.score_venues_task()],
                process=Process.sequential,
                verbose=True,
            )
  ```
  - The scores are combined with venues using combine_venues_with_scores() utility
  - The response crew generates personalized emails for each scored venue
  ```python
  @CrewBase
  class VenueResponseCrew:
      @crew
      def crew(self) -> Crew:
          return Crew(
              agents=[self.email_followup_agent()],
              tasks=[self.send_followup_email_task()],
              process=Process.sequential,
              verbose=True,
          )
  ```
  - Emails are saved to the email_responses directory

#### State Management
The state management in VenueScoreFlow is handled through the VenueScoreState Pydantic model and uses CrewAI's Flow system. Here's a detailed breakdown:
1. State Definition:
```python
class VenueScoreState(BaseModel):
    id: str = Field(default_factory=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4()))
    input_data: InputData | None = None
    venues: List[Venue] = Field(default_factory=list)
    venue_score: List[VenueScore] = Field(default_factory=list)
    hydrated_venues: List[ScoredVenues] = Field(default_factory=list)
    scored_venues_feedback: Optional[str] = None
    generated_emails: Dict[str, str] = Field(default_factory=dict)
```
2. State Initialization:
```python
@start()
async def initialize_state(self) -> None:
    print("1. Starting VenueScoreFlow")
    print("Input data:", self.state.input_data)
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = self.openai_key
    os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = self.serper_key
```
3. Data Flow Between Stages:
a. Venue Search → Venue Scoring:
```python
@listen("initialize_state")
async def search_venues(self):
    # Stores results in state.venues
    for venue_data in venues_data:
        if isinstance(venue_data, dict):
            try:
                venue = Venue(**venue_data)
                self.state.venues.append(venue)
            except ValidationError as e:
                print("Validation error for venue data:", e)
    ```
b. Venue Scoring → Venue Hydration:
```python
@listen(or_(search_venues, "score_venues_feedback"))
async def score_venues(self):
    # Stores scores in state.venue_score
    venue_scores = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    self.state.venue_score = [score for score in venue_scores if score is not None]
```
c. Venue Hydration (Combining Venues with Scores):
```python
def combine_venues_with_scores(venues: List[Venue], venue_scores: List[VenueScore]) -> List[ScoredVenues]:
    score_dict = {score.name.strip().lower(): score for score in venue_scores}
    scored_venues = []
    for venue in venues:
        normalized_name = venue.name.strip().lower()
        score = score_dict.get(normalized_name)
        if score:
            scored_venues.append(
                ScoredVenues(
                    id=venue.id,
                    name=venue.name,
                    # ... other fields ...
                    score=score.score,
                    reason=score.reason,
                )
            )
```
4. Email Generation Stage:
```python
@listen("hydrate_venues")
async def write_and_save_emails(self):
    # Stores generated emails in state.generated_emails
    async def write_email(venue):
        result = await VenueResponseCrew().crew().kickoff_async(inputs={...})
        self.state.generated_emails[venue.name] = result.raw
```
The state management follows these key principles:
- All data is stored in the Pydantic-based VenueScoreState
- Each stage listens for completion of previous stages using @listen decorators
- Data is passed between stages through the state object
- The state maintains consistency using Pydantic validation
- Asynchronous operations are handled using asyncio for concurrent processing
This design ensures thread-safe state management and maintains data integrity throughout the workflow.
