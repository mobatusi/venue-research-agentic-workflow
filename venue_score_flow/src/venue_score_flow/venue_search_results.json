The venue offers well-appointed rooms with modern decor, extensive event spaces equipped with the latest technology, and a dedicated staff known for their high level of service. However, while the venue is well-maintained, some areas show slight signs of wear which prevents the score from being higher. Additionally, the on-site dining options, though varied, have received mixed reviews concerning quality and price point, which impacted the overall impression. In conclusion, an 82 is a strong score reflecting its many positive attributes while acknowledging areas for improvement."
